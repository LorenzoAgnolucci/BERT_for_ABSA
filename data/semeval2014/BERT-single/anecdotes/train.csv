1316	The food is o.k., but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant.	anecdotes	4	none
1317	But for whatever reason, prices are about twice as high.	anecdotes	4	none
1318	It cannot be the ambience, because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle.	anecdotes	4	none
1319	The most annoying thing, though, is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue.	anecdotes	4	none
132	They have it all -- great price, food, and service.	anecdotes	4	none
1320	Nothing against a good sales call, but the tactics at Amma are just too obvious.	anecdotes	4	none

1344	A touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed.	anecdotes	4	none
1345	Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance.	anecdotes	4	none
1346	Overall, the ingredients and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves.	anecdotes	0	positive
1349	great for a romantic evening, or a fun evening with friends...	anecdotes	4	none

1631	The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.	anecdotes	4	none
1632	Still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house...	anecdotes	4	none

1640	And you're hungry a few hours later.	anecdotes	4	none
1641	Seriously, this is the best all you can eat in town- As everyone says, the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these, and you've broken even.	anecdotes	4	none
1642	I've rarely had a problem with slow staff in the 10 years I've been going.	anecdotes	4	none
1643	Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu, though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick.	anecdotes	4	none
1644	The all you can eat deal is truly amazing here.	anecdotes	4	none
1645	$20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality- I even took a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the US that he has been to.	anecdotes	4	none

1787	The Yellowtail was particularly good as well.	anecdotes	4	none

2417	I will have to say, this Bengali Fast Food joint is clearly my favorite.	anecdotes	0	positive
